Identifying music genres through lyrics has gained prominence in music research. It's crucial for enhancing music recommendation systems and search engines. Genres, defined by tempo, melody, instrumentation, and lyrics, offer insights into a song's mood and themes. This study explores rock, pop, and hip hop lyrics using NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal, alongside TF-IDF, BERT, GLOVE, and Word2Vec. ML models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, MLP, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, LSTM, and CNN are employed for classification. LSTM proves most effective. These findings benefit music recommendation accuracy and genre classification in various applications.
